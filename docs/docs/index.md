## Motivation

### EToH deserves better

The Eternal Towers of Hell community has exploded in size, but its tooling
hasn't kept pace. Other obby games like Tria.OS prove the benefits of strong
developer experience, with it's [helpful companion plugin][Tria.OS Companion Plugin]
and guides. It's time to lay the foundation for the next decade of tower
building.

Ethereal is a full-featured Eternal Towers of Hell companion plugin that
consolidates scripts, plugin functionality, tower kits, images, sound effects,
and ClientObjects into an intuitive package. External plugin APIs pave way for
future extensions.

### EToH is too complicated

ie.

- JToH Kit Tools to bootstrap a project
- JToH Part Counter to ensure your tower doesn't surpass the limits.
- Archimedes for creating curved geometry
- Gapfill from GeomTools for filling misaligned parts
- OozleDraw and AAZIER to create tightropes
- Welder to weld parts faster
- Quality-of-life plugins such as the Elttob Suite

Ethereal consolidates these resources into one widget. The amount of mental
boilerplate Ethereal removes is staggering:
