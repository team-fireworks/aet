developer experience, with it's [helpful companion plugin][Tria.OS Companion Plugin]
and guides. It's time to lay the foundation for the next decade of tower
building.

Ethereal is a full-featured Eternal Towers of Hell companion plugin that
consolidates scripts, plugin functionality, tower kits, images, sound effects,
and ClientObjects into an intuitive package. External plugin APIs pave way for
future extensions.

For example, the amount of mental boilerplate Ethereal removes is staggering:
