# Why Ethereal?

## Because EToH deserves better

It's time to lay the foundation for the next decade of tower building.

**For builders:** Ethereal consolidates essential tools and resources into a
single, intuitive package, including scripts, plugin functionality, tower kits,
images, sound effects, and ClientObjects. Other plugins can extend the Ethereal
plugin with its own functionality.

**For developers:** Ethereal exposes plugin APIs for extending the plugin with
new tools, and game APIS, for hooking onto Ethereal while playtesting. Ethereal
comes with great documentation that you're reading, type-safe APIs, and
unparalleled DX.

Down the line, Ethereal could:

- Sync custom `ClientObjectScripts` with Rojo
- Sync file system images/sound effects locally with Asphalt

Building towers in Eternal Towers of Hell can be complex, often requiring
multiple plugins and tools. Ethereal simplifies this process by consolidating
functionality from various plugin into a single, streamlined widget:

Instead of judging these plugins:

- JToH Kit Tools to bootstrap a tower
- JToH Part Counter to ensure your tower doesn't surpass the limits.
- Archimedes for creating curved geometry
- Gapfill from GeomTools for filling misaligned parts
- OozleDraw and AAZIER to create tightropes
- Welder to weld parts faster
- Quality-of-life plugins such as the Elttob Suite
