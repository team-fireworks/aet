## About commands

Ethereal exposes an API for other plugins to register commands, which contains
arguments and methods. Commands are sandboxed and disallowed from using `plugin`
APIs. Commands however receive a `CommandRun` API when ran, which enables
prompting the users for values, retrieving the workspace's default tower, and
reading plugin settings.

Take a look:

```Luau
-- require et
local Et = require(game:WaitForChild("Et", math.huge))

-- request access to the plugin API
local et = Et.request(plugin, {
    name = "My Ethereal plugin",
    icon = "rbxassetid://1234567890",
    permissions = {
        -- this permission allows registering new commands
        Et.Permissions.Commands,
    }
})

print(`Hello Et version {et.version.tostring()}!`)

et.registerCommand {
    name = "Trim ClientObject Values",
    description = "Deletes double ClientObject values which breaks the kit",

    predicates = {
        -- this predicate only passes if the user has set a tower for the current workspace
        et.predicates.isTowerSelected
    },

    run = function(run)
        assert(run.tower, "required for typechecking")
        for _, v in run.tower.ClientSidedObjects:GetDescendants() do
            if not v.Parent or not v.Name == "ClientObject" or not v:IsA("ValueObject") then
                continue
            end

            for _, c in v.Parent:GetDescendants() do
                if c.Name == "ClientObject" and c:IsA("ValueObject") and v ~= c then
                    c:Destroy()
                end
            end
        end
    end
}
```
