This obby is intentionally left uncopylocked, with the intent of inspiring
creators of all experience levels to study how it was built - and to potentially
use that knowledge to improve their creations. Credits and attributions aren't
requirements - but are highly encouraged.

However - if this obby appears in a fangame without its creator's consent, the
person who made the decision to do so, should be complained at by the community
until said appearance is undone.

If you want to support a more open-source obbying scene, consider adding this
license to your own obbies!
