This obby is intentionally left uncopylocked, with the intent of inspiring
creators of all experience levels to study how it was built - and to potentially
use that knowledge to improve their creations. Credits and attributions aren't
requirements - but are highly encouraged.

If you want to support a more open-source obbying scene, consider adding this
